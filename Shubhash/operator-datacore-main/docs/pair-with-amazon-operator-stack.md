# Pair operator-datacore with amazon-operator-stack

You now have **two complementary repos**:

| Repo | What it does |
|---|---|
| [`operator-datacore`](https://github.com/ShubhashSharma/operator-datacore) | The data layer. Five-schema Supabase database with daily Sales & Traffic mirror. |
| [`amazon-operator-stack`](https://github.com/ShubhashSharma/amazon-operator-stack) | The agent layer. MCP server connecting Claude Code to live SP-API. |

They work independently. They're far more valuable together.

## What pairing unlocks

| Without pairing | With pairing |
|---|---|
| Claude can call SP-API live (mcp-amazon) | Claude can call SP-API live AND query 24 months of historical data instantly |
| You can write SQL against `operator-datacore` (this repo) | Claude writes SQL against `operator-datacore` for you, in plain English |
| Two separate tools | One operator stack, one mental model |

---

## Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1 — Add the Supabase MCP server to Claude Code

Claude Code's MCP system can talk to Supabase via the official MCP server. Add it to your `~/.claude/mcp.json` (create if it doesn't exist):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "operator-datacore": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@supabase/mcp-server-supabase@latest"],
      "env": {
        "SUPABASE_URL": "https://YOUR-PROJECT.supabase.co",
        "SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY": "eyJ...your-service-role-key..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Use the same `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` from your `operator-datacore/.env`.

Restart Claude Code.

### Step 2 — Tell Claude what to do with it

Add this to the project's `CLAUDE.md` (or a new `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` for global use):

```markdown
## Data lake
This operator runs operator-datacore on Supabase. When asked about historical
Amazon performance (revenue, units, sessions, ASIN-level data), prefer the
data lake (`brain.sales_traffic_daily`, `analytics.amazon_daily`,
`analytics.amazon_top_asins`) over live SP-API calls — it's faster and the
numbers match Seller Central exactly.

When asked about live state (current inventory, today's orders, latest
buy-box owner), use amazon-operator-stack to call SP-API directly.

The canonical metric ownership map is at meta.report_catalog. Never
reconstruct revenue from the Orders Report.
```

### Step 3 — Try a paired query

In Claude Code:

> "What were my top 10 ASINs by revenue last month, and which one has the lowest current inventory?"

Claude will:
1. Query `analytics.amazon_top_asins` from operator-datacore (historical revenue).
2. Call `getInventorySummaries` via amazon-operator-stack (live inventory).
3. Cross-reference the two and tell you which top earner is at risk.

That's a single question that previously needed two tools, two queries, and a spreadsheet.

## Recommended division of labour

| Question type | Use |
|---|---|
| "What did we sell last week?" | operator-datacore (historical, instant, exact match to Seller Central) |
| "What's currently in stock?" | amazon-operator-stack → live FBA Inventory |
| "Which ASIN has the highest CM3?" | operator-datacore (once COGS + ad spend are wired in via homework) |
| "What's the latest fulfilment status of order 111-XXXXXXX-XXXXXXX?" | amazon-operator-stack → live Orders API |
| "Where did our search query share drop the most last quarter?" | operator-datacore (Brand Analytics rollups, once SQP connector is active) |
| "Pull the buyer's shipping address for order X" | amazon-operator-stack → RDT-scoped Orders API call (not stored anywhere) |

## Why split the layers?

We could have shoved everything into one repo. We didn't, because:

1. **Data layer ages slowly.** A schema migration is a once-a-quarter event.
2. **Agent layer iterates fast.** New tools, new prompts, new model versions. We don't want the database changing every time we redeploy the agent.
3. **You can run them independently.** Run only the data layer if you just want a Supabase mirror. Run only the agent layer if you don't want to host a database. They cooperate but don't depend on each other.
4. **Different security postures.** The data layer holds your full historical data and never makes external calls (after sync). The agent layer makes live SP-API calls but holds nothing. Different threat models, different architectures.

This is the same split that BI tools (data warehouse + dashboard) and modern MLOps (feature store + model server) use. We didn't invent it. We're just applying it to operator workflows.
