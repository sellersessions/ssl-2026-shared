# Canonical reports — the metric ownership map

The single most important rule in operator-datacore: **every metric reads from the SP-API report that owns it canonically.** No reconstruction. No "let's just calculate it from the Orders Report and a price list." This rule prevents 30-40% revenue under-counting. We learned it the hard way.

This document is the source-of-truth map. The same map is also stored in `meta.report_catalog` (queryable from SQL).

## Why no reconstruction

Each Amazon report is its own canonical accounting:

- **Orders Report** tells you what was *placed*.
- **Finances API** tells you what was *settled*.
- **Sales & Traffic Report** tells you what Amazon *shows the seller as revenue*.

These are not the same number. The deltas are not constant. They're a moving function of returns, cancellations, B2B pricing tiers, multi-channel orders, currency adjustments, gift wrap, promotional rebates, and Amazon's internal accounting calendar.

When you reconstruct revenue from `Orders + price + custom maths`, you are silently reproducing Amazon's accounting *minus* every adjustment they apply downstream, and the gap compounds over weeks.

A real client (Dr Bo, May 2026): a dashboard built on Orders-Report-derived revenue ran 30-40% under Seller Central for twelve days. Switching to direct read of `GET_SALES_AND_TRAFFIC_REPORT.ordered_product_sales` collapsed the gap to **$0.00**. The lesson: pick the report Amazon uses, store it verbatim, and report from it. Don't fight Amazon's accounting. You'll lose.

**Notes:**

- Reviews / Q&A: no first-party SP-API endpoint. Out of scope.
- Reports vs. endpoints: Reports are async (request → poll → fetch). Endpoints are sync (request → response). Different rate limits.
- **Settlement reports cannot be requested.** Amazon auto-generates them every ~14 days. The connector polls `getReports` and ingests as they appear.

## Specific gotchas baked into the schema

These are the exact gotchas that cost previous client engagements days of debugging. Each is documented in code as well.

### Sales & Traffic
- The response has TWO top-level arrays: `salesAndTrafficByDate` and `salesAndTrafficByAsin`. To get DAY × ASIN granularity you must request **one report per day**.
- Buy box percentage and conversion rate come back as percentages (0-100). We store as fractions (0.0-1.0) for consistency.

### Financial Events (`listFinancialEvents`)
- Fees come back as **negative**. Parser flips signs and stores absolute value in `amount`, with `direction='credit'|'debit'`. Original raw value preserved in `original_amount`.
- Event type names sometimes drop the `EventList` suffix in payloads (e.g. `Shipment Event` not `ShipmentEventList`). Normalise at parse time.
- **Refunds reduce gross sales (Box 1), not net total (Box 4).** Direction-guard the credit-note rule explicitly in rollups.
- Long windows (>14 days) truncate silently. **Chunk to 7-day windows.**
- Deferred events appear weeks later. Re-pull windows that overlap the previous 30 days.

### Orders Report
- Use `BY_LAST_UPDATE_GENERAL` for ingestion (catches status changes). Use `BY_ORDER_DATE_GENERAL` for cohort analysis.
- PII (buyer name, email, full address) is **stripped** in the report. For PII you need the Orders API + Restricted Data Token. operator-datacore deliberately doesn't store PII in v1.

### Settlement
- The XML and v1 flat-file variants are deprecated. Only use `GET_V2_SETTLEMENT_REPORT_DATA_FLAT_FILE_V2`.
- One settlement spans 2 weeks. Settlement lines link to orders by `amazon_order_id` but **not all lines have an order ID** (transfers, adjustments, fees-not-tied-to-orders).

### FBA Inventory
- The Manage Inventory snapshot is not equal to "available" everywhere. Pair with the inventory ledger for reconciliation.
- Reserved inventory has three buckets (customer orders, FC transfers, FC processing). **Don't sum them into one.**

### Brand Analytics
- 17-month lookback for monthly Search Query Performance. Older isn't accessible.
- One period per call. You can't span quarters.

### Ads API v3
- Separate OAuth flow from SP-API. Separate refresh tokens.
- 95-day lookback ceiling. Anything older has to come from your own historical exports.
- Reports revise for up to 14 days post-period. Re-pull recent windows.
